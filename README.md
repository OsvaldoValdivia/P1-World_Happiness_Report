## Summary of the project

Description:

This project aims to analyze and visualize the happiness scores and rankings derived from the Gallup World Poll for the years 2015-2019. The project will focus on analyzing the main life evaluation question, known as the Cantril ladder, which rates respondents current lives on a scale from 0 to 10 (Happiness Score).
